Dewpoint is a wrapper for the excellent libcloud library.  A
compatible version (0.3.1) is packaged with dewpoint.

Configuration files for dewpoint by default can be stored in
~/.dewpoint/dewpoint.ini.  They are in standard ini format and look
like this:

-----

[default]
provider: rackspace

[rackspace]
user: YOUR USER
key: YOUR API KEY
default_size: 256
default_image: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (lucid)

-----

Please note that this tool has so far only been tested against
RackSpace Cloud, although the interface should be capable of supporting
other libcloud providers without too much additional work.
